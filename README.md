# 📊 Marketing Campaigns Machine Learning Project

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing campaign data using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **hypothesis testing**, and **machine learning techniques** to understand customer behavior and identify the key factors influencing campaign acceptance.

The analysis is based on the **Marketing Mix (4Ps)** framework: People, Product, Place, and Promotion.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior  
- Clean and preprocess real-world marketing data  
- Perform feature engineering to create meaningful variables  
- Test marketing-related hypotheses  
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict campaign acceptance  

---

## 📈 Dataset Description
The dataset includes variables related to:
- **People:** Age, Education, Income, Marital Status  
- **Product:** Spending on wines, fruits, meat, fish, sweets, and gold products  
- **Place:** Web, catalog, and in-store purchases  
- **Promotion:** Campaign responses and acceptance  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
The project follows these main steps:
- Data import and initial inspection  
- Data cleaning and income imputation based on education and marital status  
- Feature engineering (age, total children, total spending, total purchases)  
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization  
- Hypothesis testing related to customer behavior  
- Machine learning classification using:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Gradient Boosting  

Model performance is evaluated using **ROC curves** and **AUC scores**.

---

## 📊 Results
All models demonstrated strong predictive performance.  
The **Gradient Boosting model** achieved the highest AUC score, making it the best-performing model for predicting customer acceptance of the marketing campaign.
